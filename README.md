# Concert-Booker
A REST web service for a concert booking system. Uses JAX-RS, JPA and Swing. 

Currently the GUI is incomplete as my supervisor is implementing this. 

You can clone the respository and import using maven; run the tests to see that the REST webservice and subscription service is indeed working.
